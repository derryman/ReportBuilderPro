# Sample Reports

Place your 3 sample PDF files here with these exact names:

- `report1.pdf` - Cover Page
- `report2.pdf` - Meeting Minutes
- `report3.pdf` - Progress

**How it works:**
- Files in the `public` folder are copied directly to the build output
- They can be accessed at `/reports/filename.pdf`
- The Template Library page will automatically display and allow viewing these PDFs
